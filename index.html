            <h3>introduction</h3>
            <p>Hello! My name is Raine Ponce (pronounced just like “rain”) and I am currently studying Digital Media at
                UCF
                (University of Central Florida). Specifically, I chose the “Web and Social Platforms” track, and it has
                definitely been an interesting journey so far! I have always loved creating visual works that express
                specific ideas, though I did not do this digitally at first. Here is a brief look into my media
                meanderings, from traditional art to graphic design to digital media.</p>

            <h3>high school</h3>
            <p>At Cypress Creek High School, I began exploring digital design and art within my elective classes in
                addition to taking
                AP Computer Science. In addition to learning about design principles and creating designs like the
                pictured brochure, I was able to earn <a href="https://www.credly.com/users/raine-ponce"
                    target="_blank">certifications</a>
                in programs such as Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator in my digital design class. In my art
                classes, I got to
                develop my <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/_raine.draws_/?igsh=MTZtYmJvcGRyejdhcg%3D%3D&utm_source=qr"
                    target="_blank">traditional art</a> skills and enter a few art shows. Lastly, in my last two years,
                I learned
                how to create and edit videos for the school's National Technical Honor Society.</p>

            <h3>community college</h3>
            <p>To follow up on dual enrollment classes taken in high school, I went to complete my A.A. degree
                requirements at Valencia College. There, I further developed my art and design skills while also gaining
                more exposure to digital media and art history. The introductory digital media classes allowed for more
                Adobe program practice and the art history classes increased my appreciation for art, composition, and
                conveying meaning visually. It was also around this time that I also took more interest in digital art,
                learning more about Procreate and Photoshop to create some of my <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/_raine.draws_/p/CvBOT50P5wr/?img_index=1"
                    target="_blank">assignments</a>, such as the comic shown here.</p>

            <img class="left" src="img/universityPic.png" alt="Cartoon laptop displaying a website screenshot">
            <h3>university</h3>
            <p>After transferring into the University of Central Florida, I was able to take more digital media
                fundamental classes in order to officially become a Digital Media major. In these classes, I began
                learning about HTML and CSS while also gaining a bit more practice with Adobe programs and video
                editing. I also learned more about the digital creative process as well as how to consider different
                perspectives of future viewers or clients while creating something. The following semester (this
                semester), I continued to learn much about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This gave me the opportunity to
                create lots of practice web pages, such as <a
                    href="https://raineponce.github.io/make-it-pop/" target="_blank">this one</a>,
                to learn more about the inner workings of websites and the process for designing them.

            <h3>personal projects</h3>
            <p>Outside of school, I have also done a few small commissions for friends, which helped give me an idea of
                how I may collaborate with clients in the future. One of my first commissions was a logo design for one
                of my friend's entrepreneur competitions for start-ups, and I learned much about how to brainstorm ideas
                and refine them while keeping my friend's requirements in mind. I followed a similar process to create a
                book cover for another friend writing a book, and at the time of writing this, I have been working on
                designing a tattoo for a close friend, and that involves gaining more experience with digital art and
                vector art.
                Overall, these experiences have helped me develop my skills in working with others and creating digital
                media, so I look forward to
                searching for similar opportunities and experiences in the future!</p>
